# Electoral_Bonds_Analysis
This project involves the analysis of electoral bonds transactions data to gain insights into the funding patterns of political parties and companies in India. The analysis is conducted using SQL queries to perform various tasks such as calculating total amounts, comparing distributions, identifying trends, and detecting anomalies in the data.
## Overview
Electoral bonds were introduced as a mode of funding for political parties in India in 2017. However, they were later struck down as unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2024. This project focuses on analyzing the transactions related to electoral bonds to understand the financial dynamics between political parties and companies during this period.

    2. Electoral Bonds_Companies: Contains data on companies purchasing electoral bonds, including the date of purchase, the name of the purchaser, and the denomination of the bond.
## Tasks
The following tasks are performed using SQL queries:

    1. Analysis of Electoral Bonds Transactions:
        -Calculating the total amount of electoral bonds encashed by each political party.
        -Determining the top political parties receiving the highest total amount through electoral bonds.
        -Visualizing the trend of electoral bonds encashment over time for each political party.

        -Determining the frequency of electoral bond encashments for major political parties.

    3. Purchaser Analysis:
        -Analyzing the dataset of companies purchasing electoral bonds.
        -Determining the top companies purchasing electoral bonds by total amount or frequency.
## Usage
